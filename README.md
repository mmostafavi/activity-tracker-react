## explanation

### core idea
core idea is adapted from `chains.cc` but I developed everything from scratch and added some humor and nice UI/UX to it.

### disclaimer
I'm not introducing this app as a reliable and safe service which you can use.
It's just a medium size react app which I developed it to get exprience in Authentication and data flow in a sample react app

### way to go!
It's not commplete and it can get much better, so if you have an idea or are interested in adding or editing some features in app, just do it and create a pull request.
